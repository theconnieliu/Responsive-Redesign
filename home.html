    <h1 class= "title-accent">The Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>In CS1300, we were asked to pick one page of a website to analyze based on usability and accessibility standards, and then to 
      redesign and build the redesigned version of the webpage. Given the state of the world at the time, 
      I chose the website of a local business from my hometown that is not only very close to my heart, 
      but in desperate need of modernization in the tumultuous climate of 2020– the <b>Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory</b> in San Francisco.

    <h4>Reasoning: About The Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory</h4>
    <p>The Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory is a <b>family owned business</b> operating out of San Francisco’s Chinatown, an area that has been 
      hit drastically due to the coronavirus pandemic. Operating since 1962, they are <b>a staple of the city’s culture and a 
      tourist destination for visitors</b>. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Chinese products and business have always been <b>stereotyped as inferior or questionable in legitimacy and quality due to a lack of 
      adherence to western aesthetics, formatting standards, and language</b>. Through this redesign I hope to develop for the 
      Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory a more modern visual brand, a welcoming persona, and an improved user experience for the people 
      around the world that visit the website and the factory.

    <h2>Identifying Problems: Visit Page</h2>
    <p>
      The visit page is a crucial part of the company’s website– it is how tourists and visitors from around the world can come to navigate 
      towards the factory. Given the complex and compact layout of Chinatown as well, it can be especially challenging to locate a small 
      business. Analyzing the website, there were several usability and accessibility issues that were in need of redesigning.

    <h2>Acessibility</h2>
    <p>In addition to the usability issues I observed, I ran the factory's website through accessibility tests, namely WebAim Wave and Mac's VoiceOver,
      and found several  pain points and accessibility issues.</p>
      <br>
      <div class ="card-container">

        </div>
      <div class= "card-body">
        <p class= "card-text">
          WebAim WAVE found the text on the screen to be too small, almost all of the images to be missing alternate texts, and the few 
          alternate texts on the site being insufficient or containing extraneous information. The screenreader couldn’t read the site’s 
          content in the correct order. Due to the overlapping of elements on the page and hard-coded formatting, it would break off 
          mid-paragraph to read the text of an entirely different block of content.

    <h2>Visual Redesign Process</h2>
    <p>
      With these usability and accessibility issues in mind, I started on my redesign of the site. Using <b>Invision</b>, I created three 
      low-fidelity wireframes of a new site that would address each of the discovered issues. I liked how quick and simple Invision
      was to use, but definitely wished they had a "Layers" panel like Figma, which would have saved me much time and effort. Overall,
      it was still great to be able to sketch out the skeleton of my site quickly.
    </p>

    <h4>Low-fidelity Wireframe</h4>

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>From these low-fidelity wireframes, I created three high-fidelity wireframes of the site with <b>Figma</b>, one for each screensize of either 
      a desktop, an iPad, or an iPhone, all while keeping in mind how the design would be achieved via HTML and CSS. It was super fun 
      to play around on Figma, as well as reinvent the visual brand of the factory.

    <h2>Visual Design Style Guide</h2>
    <p>
      While designing, I developed a design system to keeping the interactions consistent throughout a product, ensuring cohesive and visually
      memorable experience.

    <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
    <p>From these wireframes I created the final website, viewable <a href= "https://floating-gorge-36246.herokuapp.com/">here<a>.</p>

      <h3>Final Redesign Observations</h3>

    <p>With this new redesign, the website is fully responsive to every screen size. Crucial information is well formatted into their 
      respective sections and containers, making it easy for users to identify and follow the information that is most relevant to them. 
      The visual brand of the website is matched with the company’s real life store, and is welcoming and friendly. Font sizes and 
      the entire layout of the website adapt  to different device and browser sizes. This will all make it much easier for visitors to 
      access information and visit the factory.

    <h2>Takeaways + Lessons Learned:</h2>
    <p>This was my first time having to redesign the entire page of a website, as well as having to code a responsive website.
      Once again, a deep dive into "doing," in this case jumping right in to coding with HTML and CSS, expedited the learning
      process and I am now much more comfortable with making responsive sites and using HTML and CSS in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also super meaningful for me to have th opportunity to redesign the website of a factory that is so close to home in 
      my heart. To help an Asian local family-owned business is something I could contribute more to, especially considering the 
      considerable detriment that community has faced in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm very thankful to have gotten to complete
      this project!
